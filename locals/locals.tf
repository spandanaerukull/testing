#locals  is used for getting output get particular information about project 
#example output is : final_name = "roboshop-dev-cart"


# in locals we can assign functins and expressions to name and you can use it wher ever you want 
#We cannot over ridden in the local, which we can't do the over rides, for that we use locals 
# variable can be overriden, locals can't be overriden

#this syntax i used in ec22 block at security group in terraform 
#just see how it works 
#we should not use locals in side syntax just use local
